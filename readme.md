# e-terface



e-terface is, in short, software that turns your desktop environment into a webapp.

Think of your favorite website, and imagine being able to navigate your operating

system just like that. Or perhaps even cooler, turning it into a Flash movie.

The idea of e-terface came from the fact that most desktop customization tools
(if not all of them) exist as a framework or API. To use them, you need to know
how to program in C/C++ or a similar language. Since web technology offers
powerful visualization, why not see how far it can go? Web technologies like
HTML continue to advance every day. Even complete applications could be made
simply using HTML and JavaScript. If nothing else, e-terface can allow you
to view documents and navigate your OS remotely (basically a remote desktop).

e-terface gets its name from things like e-mail and e-commerce. The idea is that
the interface is not native to the OS, and is web-based.

This is version 1.0, and has been tested on Windows 7 and CentOS.
